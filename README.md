This code (using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) shows how to constructed the confidence contour for 
a set of dark energy parameters derived from a CPL parameterisation using standard 
ruler data (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations -BAO-) and SNe Ia standard candle data from a heterogeneous sample (UNION2)
